## Introduction

**Webcrumbs** aims to be the Wordpress for React applications. Create, modify, and manage features on your React websites without any coding skills necessary. Designed for both developers and non-developers, Webcrumbs allows you to add features using an intuitive admin panel.

## Features

- **Plugin Platform:** Easily add and manage React plugins (functions, not libraries) to extend your website's functionality.
- **No-Code Admin Panel:** Add features, create content, and manage your site all from a user-friendly admin interface.
- **Customizable:** For those who like to get their hands dirty, Webcrumbs is fully customizable.

## Is That All?

No, it's not. When WordPress was created, the digital landscape was vastly different than what it is today. Websites were primarily the domain of developers and perhaps some designers. Fast forward to now, and websites touch nearly every aspect of an organization. Marketing teams, design squads, copywriters, business strategists, and, of course, developers all have a stake in an organization's web presence. 

**Webcrumbs** is designed with this evolved landscape in mind. It's not just a tool for one department; it's a platform that allows each department to have the level of participation they own in the website. Whether it's marketing launching a new campaign, design tweaking the UI/UX, or copywriters updating content, Webcrumbs aims to provide a unified platform for all.

But that's not all. Webcrumbs also opens up opportunities for developers. By creating a platform for React plugins, we allow developers to offer functionalities to businesses. These plugins can be free or paid, enabling developers to provide value and receive value in return. In essence, Webcrumbs aims to be more than just a no-code solution for building React websites; it aims to be a comprehensive platform that bridges the gap between different departments and provides opportunities for developers to contribute to the ecosystem.
